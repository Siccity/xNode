### xNode
Thinking of developing a node-based plugin? Then this is for you. You can download it as an archive and unpack to a new unity project, or connect it as git submodule.

xNode is super userfriendly, intuitive and will help you reap the benefits of node graphs in no time.
With a minimal footprint, it is ideal as a base for custom state machines, dialogue systems, decision makers etc.

### Key features
* Lightweight in runtime
* Very little boilerplate code
* Strong separation of editor and runtime code
* No runtime reflection (unless you need to edit/build node graphs at runtime. In this case, all reflection is cached.)
* Does not rely on any 3rd party plugins
* Custom node inspector code is very similar to regular custom inspector code
* Supported from Unity 5.3 and up

### Wiki
* [Getting started](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode/wiki/Getting%20Started) - create your very first node node and graph
* [Examples branch](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode/tree/examples) - look at other small projects

### Installation
<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

### Installing with Unity Package Manager
***Via Git URL***
*(Requires Unity version 2018.3.0b7  or above)*

To install this project as a [Git dependency](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html) using the Unity Package Manager,
add the following line to your project's `manifest.json`:

```
"com.github.siccity.xnode": "https://github.com/siccity/xNode.git"
```

You will need to have Git installed and available in your system's PATH.

If you are using [Assembly Definitions](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html) in your project, you will need to add `XNode` and/or `XNodeEditor` as Assembly Definition References.

***Via OpenUPM***

The package is available on the [openupm registry](https://openupm.com). It's recommended to install it via [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli).

```
openupm add com.github.siccity.xnode
```

### Installing with git
***Via Git Submodule***

To add xNode as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) in your existing git project,
run the following git command from your project root:

```
git submodule add git@github.com:Siccity/xNode.git Assets/Submodules/xNode
```

### Installing 'the old way'
If no source control or package manager is available to you, you can simply copy/paste the source files into your assets folder.

### Node example:
```csharp
// public classes deriving from Node are registered as nodes for use within a graph
public class MathNode : Node {
    // Adding [Input] or [Output] is all you need to do to register a field as a valid port on your node 
    [Input] public float a;
    [Input] public float b;
    // The value of an output node field is not used for anything, but could be used for caching output results
    [Output] public float result;
    [Output] public float sum;

    // The value of 'mathType' will be displayed on the node in an editable format, similar to the inspector
    public MathType mathType = MathType.Add;
    public enum MathType { Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide}
    
    // GetValue should be overridden to return a value for any specified output port
    public override object GetValue(NodePort port) {

        // Get new a and b values from input connections. Fallback to field values if input is not connected
        float a = GetInputValue<float>("a", this.a);
        float b = GetInputValue<float>("b", this.b);

        // After you've gotten your input values, you can perform your calculations and return a value
        if (port.fieldName == "result")
            switch(mathType) {
                case MathType.Add: default: return a + b;
                case MathType.Subtract: return a - b;
                case MathType.Multiply: return a * b;
                case MathType.Divide: return a / b;
            }
        else if (port.fieldName == "sum") return a + b;
        else return 0f;
    }
}
```

### Plugins
Plugins are repositories that add functionality to xNode
* [xNodeGroups](https://github.com/Siccity/xNodeGroups): adds resizable groups
